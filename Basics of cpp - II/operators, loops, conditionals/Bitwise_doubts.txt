Q>> difference between:
      bool a = false;  
      cout << ~a;
    
     AND
 
      bool a = false;  
      a=(~a);
      cout << a

The two code snippets you provided have a small difference in how they use the bitwise NOT operator (~). Let's break down the differences:
Code Snippet 1:
	bool a = false;
	cout << ~a;
In this snippet, you are directly applying the bitwise NOT operator to the boolean variable a. However, when you use the bitwise NOT operator on a boolean value in C++, it's implicitly converted to an integer before the bitwise operation. In C++, false is often represented as 0, so ~a would be equivalent to ~0, which results in an integer with all bits set to 1. When you print this, it may not display as true, but as an integer value representing the bitwise NOT result.

Code Snippet 2:
	bool a = false;
	a = ~a;
	cout << a;
In this snippet, you are explicitly assigning the result of the bitwise NOT operation back to the boolean variable a. After this operation, a will be true because the bitwise NOT of false (0) is true (1).

In summary, while both snippets involve applying the bitwise NOT operator to a boolean variable, the first snippet directly prints the result without storing it back in the variable, and the second snippet updates the variable and then prints it. The second snippet is more common when you want to update the value of a boolean variable based on the bitwise NOT operation.
